My journey was in the area of information technology, where I was involved in systems administration and configuration, as well as software engineering. I have dedicated myself mainly to SRE and DevOps practices.

With experience in IT, I have a solid knowledge of managing systems, developing software, and dealing with configurations. I specialized in SRE practices and DevOps culture, gaining experience in managing and implementing services and information systems. I work with Linux services and systems, manage containerized applications, and deal with continuous integration, software delivery, monitoring systems, and metrics.

As an enthusiast of DevOps culture and SRE practices, I am always looking for ways to improve performance, automate processes, and ensure security, while maintaining stability, resilience, and scalability. I have extensive knowledge of technological infrastructure solutions, including virtualized environments, cloud computing, and containerized applications.

I am transitioning into software development and distributed systems, with a significant emphasis on building and maintaining APIs. My journey is currently based on using Ruby on Rails, where I have been exploring the fundamentals of web development and creating dynamic and scalable applications. I am looking to expand my knowledge and apply my skills in the context of distributed systems, focusing especially on API architecture and the scalability of these systems. I am committed to learning and applying the principles of service-oriented design (SOA) and microservices, aiming to build highly modular and flexible systems. I am directing my efforts to specialize in backend development, focusing on building robust and scalable systems. I aim to deepen my expertise in frameworks and technologies specifically aimed at the backend, aiming to develop efficient and reliable APIs.

I consider myself a collaborative professional, I like to work as a team and seek innovative and effective solutions to meet client needs. With solid problem-solving and leadership skills, I am always ready to face new challenges and find effective solutions. I value technical excellence and stay up to date with the latest technologies and methods to ensure my solutions are always up to date-and effective.
