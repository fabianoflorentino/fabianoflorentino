I have extensive experience in the fields of systems administration, software engineering, and setting management. I have spent much of my career specializing in SRE and DevOps approaches, where I have developed a wealth of knowledge about managing and deploying information and information systems. I have knowledge of Linux services and computer systems, as well as containerized application management, continuous integration, and delivery, and metrics and monitoring tools.

DevOps is my passion, so I'm constantly searching for methods to enhance performance, automation, stability, resilience, scalability, and safety. I am well-versed in all aspects of technological infrastructure solutions, such as cloud computing, container applications, and virtualized environments. I have also worked on sophisticated information security systems thanks to my knowledge of Public Key Infrastructure and ICP-Brazil certifications.

I am a cooperative professional that enjoys working in teams and coming up with effective new ways to suit the demands of my clients. I have outstanding problem-solving and leadership abilities, and I'm always prepared to take on new tasks and come up with workable answers. To guarantee that my solutions are current and successful, technical excellence is important to me, and I am always studying new technologies and processes.
