With a consolidated trajectory in Information Technology, I focused on systems administration and configuration, in addition to exploring software engineering, with an emphasis on practices such as Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and DevOps. I acquired expertise in systems management, software development, and configurations, specializing in SRE and DevOps. My experience includes managing and implementing information systems and services, dealing with Linux systems, containerized applications, continuous integration, software delivery, monitoring, and metrics.

As an enthusiast of DevOps and SRE cultures, I am always looking for performance optimization, process automation, and security assurance, prioritizing the stability, resilience, and scalability of systems. I have extensive knowledge of technological infrastructure, including virtualized environments, cloud computing, and containerized applications.

Currently, I am transitioning to the software development area, focusing on building and maintaining APIs in distributed systems. My Ruby on Rails experience ranges from web development fundamentals to scalable applications. With a comprehensive experience in Ruby on Rails, which ranges from the basics of web development to creating scalable applications, I am committed to improving my expertise in API architecture, and scalability and applying design principles aimed at services and microservices. I focus on backend development to build robust and highly scalable systems, making use of frameworks and technologies specialized in reliable and efficient APIs. I am an enthusiastic collaborator, passionate about working as a team in the search for innovative and effective solutions, with proven problem-solving and leadership skills. I am always ready to face new challenges and stay up to date with the latest trends and practices in the sector.
