My journey was in the area of information technology, where I was involved in systems administration and configuration, as well as software engineering. I have dedicated myself mainly to SRE and DevOps practices.

With experience in IT, I have a solid knowledge of managing systems, developing software, and dealing with configurations. I specialized in SRE practices and DevOps culture, gaining experience in managing and implementing services and information systems. I work with Linux services and systems, manage containerized applications, and deal with continuous integration, software delivery, monitoring systems, and metrics.

As an enthusiast of DevOps culture and SRE practices, I am always looking for ways to improve performance, automate processes, and ensure security, while maintaining stability, resilience, and scalability. I have extensive knowledge of technological infrastructure solutions, including virtualized environments, cloud computing, and containerized applications.

I'm transitioning to the software development area, focusing on building and maintaining APIs in distributed systems. My current knowledge of Ruby on Rails covers the fundamentals of web development and scalable applications. I seek to expand my expertise in API architecture, scalability, and application of service-oriented design principles and microservices to create modular and flexible systems. I focus on backend development, aiming to build robust and scalable systems through frameworks and technologies specialized in efficient and reliable APIs.

I consider myself a collaborative professional, I like to work as a team and seek innovative and effective solutions to meet client needs. With solid problem-solving and leadership skills, I am always ready to face new challenges and find effective solutions. I value technical excellence and stay up to date with the latest technologies and methods to ensure my solutions are always up to date-and effective.
